## Future Universities

### Insufficient work: very slow process and remains out of reach
### Youth fate: Parents background, region of residence
### College and Universities: Only for few and previlidged
### Govt and educational leaders dont think to make education inclusive
### Excellence through narrowness, small numbers, big classes not any good , expansion not good 
### Equity and fairness are not in picture 

---
class: 

### Present universities model built on exclusivity 
### Cost can not be reduced unless we scale higher education
### Main question: How to drive human capital to scale

Talent uninspiredm, talent uneducated
90 million youth , how it can have access to education 24/7
