**Two observations in point** 
- First : ratings remained poor during the tenure of the Shebaz Sharif government before induction of Ishaq Dar as FM but it went further down as he took oath due to his sustained defiance against impelementing IMF conditions by Moody's and S&P.

> Clearly, new rules apply to Pakistan as the economic morass deepens with each administration (civilian and military) resisting implementation of politically challenging structural reforms, a trend that continues to this day indicated by: (i) the IMF decision in the 2019 loan agreement to place the onus to secure financing from international partners on Pakistan as in previous programmes approval by the Fund generated the external financing requirements; (ii) the linkage of pledged assistance by our international partners, including the three friendly countries – China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, on being on an active IMF programme prior to disbursement; and (iii) the rating agencies not responding positively to a programme or tranche approval by the Fund. 


> Moody’s comment post elections states that: “overall uncertainty around Pakistan’s ability to quickly negotiate a new IMF program after the current one expires in April 2024 remains very high…uncertainty around the extent of public protests because they may challenge the legitimacy of the new government. Social tensions may increase which would likely constrain the government’s ability to undertake reforms.”

> We can actually increase the direct tax revenue multifold by implementing 10% ushar on agriculture produce that on average is USD 68-70 billion per annum, making us the seventh largest producer of agriculture in the world. 

> It is to be noted that the 5% of individuals holding 62% of agriculture land, who also control the intermediaries, have flour, sugar, rice and textile mills, and are always a part of every government and power structure, need to be taxed. Retail tax of the top 20% retailers along with real estate tax on the files being held for six months, alone can contribute a substantial amount to the exchequer.

> The high level of grants/subsidies, defence expenditure, pay & pensions, cost of running the government, and PSDP are all financed through additional unproductive debt and the debt trap including the circular debt is like a crocodile jaw that's ever expanding .
