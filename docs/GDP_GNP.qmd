Hi everybody! Thank you so much for joining today's session.

## Understanding the economy

![gdp vs gnp](images/gdp.jpg)

::: notes
In this presentation, we will delve into two crucial economic indicators: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Product (GNP). Understanding these measures is essential for assessing a country's economic health and performance. We will explore their definitions, differences, and their significance in analyzing a nation's economic well-being.
:::

## What is GDP?

![](images/gdp1.jpg)

**Measures the monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific period (usually a year).**

-   Focuses on economic activity happening within the geographical boundaries. Includes:
-   Manufacturing output
-   Agricultural production
-   Service industries (tourism, healthcare, etc.)
-   Government spending

::: notes
Think of GDP as a snapshot of a country's internal economic activity. It captures the total value of all finished goods and services produced within its borders, regardless of who produces them. Whether it's a foreign company operating a factory or a local entrepreneur running a restaurant, their contribution to the final product or service falls under GDP if it takes place within the country's borders.

## GDP includes

-   It includes the value of final goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy, including households, businesses, and government regardless of who produces them. Whether it's a foreign company operating a factory or a local entrepreneur running a restaurant, their contribution to the final product or service falls under GDP if it takes place within the country's borders.
-   GDP is often used as a key indicator of a country's economic health and standard of living.

## Components of GDP

::: incremental
   

-    1.  **Consumption (C):** Total spending by households on goods and services.

   

-   2.  **Investment (I):** Total spending on capital goods, such as machinery, equipment, and construction.

   

-   3.  **Government Spending (G):** Total spending by the government on goods and services.

  

-   4.  **Net Exports (NX):** The value of exports minus the value of imports.
:::
## What is GNP?

![](images/gnp.jpg){fig-align="left" }

Represents the market value of all final goods and services produced by a country's residents, regardless of their location. Focuses on the nationality of the producers, not the geographical location of production. Includes: Production by domestic companies abroad Earnings from foreign investments Excludes: Production within the country by foreign companies

::: notes
GNP offers a broader perspective, encompassing the economic contributions of a country's citizens beyond its borders. Imagine a Japanese car company operating a factory in the United States. While the car's production adds to the US GDP, it contributes to Japan's GNP due to the Japanese ownership. This wider lens helps understand a country's overall economic strength and its citizens' global economic involvement.

## Key Differences: GDP vs. GNP

![](images/gdp_gnp.jpg){fig-align="center" }

Focus: GDP: Location of production GNP: Nationality of producers Includes: GDP: All production within borders GNP: Domestic production only (regardless of location) Excludes: GDP: Domestic production by foreign companies GNP: Production within borders by foreign companies Values: Often similar for closed economies Can differ significantly for open economies

::: notes
The core difference lies in their perspectives. GDP measures what happens within a country's borders, while GNP focuses on the contributions of its citizens, no matter where they occur. This distinction can significantly impact their values. In a closed economy with minimal foreign interaction, GDP and GNP might be close. However, for open economies with substantial foreign trade and investment, the two metrics can diverge significantly.
:::

## When to Use Which?

![](images/gdp2.jpg){fig-align="center" width="669"}

-   Assessing domestic economic activity and living standards Comparing economic performance across countries with similar levels of openness

-   GNP: Understanding a country's global economic involvement Comparing economic performance across countries with diverse levels of openness Analyzing the well-being of a country's citizens, regardless of their location

::: notes
Choosing the right metric depends on your specific question. If you're interested in a country's internal economic health and how well its residents are doing within its borders, GDP is a good starting point. However, if you want to understand a country's global economic footprint and the involvement of its citizens worldwide, GNP is the better choice. It's also crucial to consider the country's level of openness to foreign trade and investment, as this can significantly impact the two measures.

## Gross National Product (GNP){.scrollable}

-   GNP measures the total value of all goods and services produced by the residents of a country, both domestically and abroad, during a specific period.
-   Unlike GDP, GNP includes income earned by residents from investments and work abroad, as well as income earned by foreign residents within the country.
-   GNP provides a broader measure of a country's economic output by accounting for its citizens' economic activities globally.

. . .

### Calculation of GNP

GNP = GDP + Net income earned from abroad

-   Net income earned from abroad includes income earned by residents from investments, dividends, interest, and wages in foreign countries, minus similar payments made to foreign residents within the country.


## Key Differences {.scrollable}

1.  **Scope:** GDP measures economic activity within a country's borders, while GNP measures economic activity by its residents globally.
2.  **Income Sources:** GDP includes income earned by both residents and non-residents within the country, while GNP includes income earned by residents globally.
3.  **Impact of Foreign Investment:** GNP is influenced by a country's investments and economic activities abroad, while GDP is not.

-   GDP and GNP are essential indicators for assessing the economic performance and standard of living of a country.
-   Understanding the differences between GDP and GNP helps policymakers, economists, and investors make informed decisions about economic policies, investments, and trade strategies.



## Limitations of GDP 

-   **Excludes Non-Market Transactions**: GDP does not account for non-market activities such as household work, volunteerism, and the underground economy.

-   **Ignores Distribution of Income**: GDP doesn't consider how income is distributed among the population. It's possible for GDP to rise while income inequality worsens.

-   **Neglects Environmental Degradation**: GDP growth often comes at the expense of natural resources and environmental degradation, but GDP itself doesn't reflect these costs.

## Limitations of GDP (contd.)

-   **Ignores Quality of Life**: GDP does not capture factors such as education, healthcare, and overall quality of life, which are crucial for well-being but not directly related to economic output.

-   **Doesn't Measure Informal Economy**: A significant portion of economic activity, especially in developing countries, occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in GDP figures.

-   **Focuses on Quantity, Not Quality**: GDP growth may not necessarily lead to improvements in overall well-being if it's driven by quantity rather than quality of goods and services produced.

## Alternative Measures 

Several alternative measures have been proposed to complement GDP: 

::: incremental 

-  **Gross National Happiness (GNH):** Measures the overall happiness and well-being of a population.

-  **Human Development Index (HDI):** Considers factors such as life expectancy, education, and income.


-  **Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI):** Attempts to account for social and environmental factors alongside economic ones. 

::: 

## Conclusion
While GDP is a valuable indicator of economic activity, it's not sufficient on its own to gauge overall well-being and progress.
But so far no single number is as powerful as GDP in capturing the complexity of a nation's economy.
