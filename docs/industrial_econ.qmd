[A futuristic Industrial Policy](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2452503/a-futuristic-industrial-policy)

**National Industrial Policy 2023**

An Industrial Advisory Council has articulated its vision of an export-led industrial development to take Pakistan’s exports to $100 billion within five years.


---

-   **Current Industrial Landscape**

An appraisal of Pakistan’s existing industrial architecture and its structural frailties: The current industrial structure has made Pakistan’s economy an outlier in a high-growth geographical region, despite being surrounded by fast-growing economies such as China and India.

-   **Structural Dysfunction**

Pakistan's imports of $55.3 billion were double its exports during FY 2022-23, with only a fraction of imports used as inputs for export-oriented production. This indicates a significant imbalance and highlights the structural dysfunction of Pakistan's industrial sector.

---

-   **Rationale for Industrial Policy** 

Divergent Views : National industrial policy vs. market-led development. While some argue for market-led development, others point to successful examples like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, which have used industrial policies effectively.

-   **4 Major Distortions in Pakistan's Industrial Structure** 

  -   1. Anti-export bias
  -   2. Reliance on import substitution
  -   3. Market-seeking FDI
  -   4. Policy capture 

These distortions hinder export-led growth and efficiency. 

--- 

**Anti-Export Bias**
  - Pakistan’s industrial architecture exhibits an anti-export bias due to high import tariffs, incentivizing domestic industries to prioritize local sales over exports.
  - For instance, a product priced at $100 globally, after a 20% import tariff, is sold for $120 domestically, discouraging exports.
  - This bias results in multiple damages: (a) Consumers pay higher prices domestically, (b) Domestic producers, shielded from competition, rely on captive domestic markets, and (c) Even if production costs are below $100, exporters find it more profitable to sell domestically at $120.
  - Thus, the anti-export bias hampers export competitiveness and perpetuates reliance on domestic markets.

---

**Import Substitution**

- Import Substitution and FDI Challenges
  - Import substitution remains a dominant strategy for industrial development, supported by decision-makers. While advocated for saving foreign exchange, it hinders export competitiveness.
  - Protected import substitution industries, being noncompetitive, contribute to the permanent burden on foreign exchange by relying on imported inputs.
  
--- 

-   **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**
  - Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Pakistan's industrial sector tends to be market-seeking rather than efficiency-seeking. Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) focus on local production, consuming foreign exchange for imported inputs and repatriating profits abroad. 
  
-   **Policy Capture**
  - Policy capture is prevalent in Pakistan's industrial structure, leading to inefficiency and reliance on state interventions and protection. Subsidies and protection fail to address viability concerns post-subsidy withdrawal, perpetuating industry dependence on state support and inhibiting growth beyond infancy stage.

---

-   **Need for Radical Reforms**
A forward-looking industrial policy needs to institute radical reforms at both the structural and enterprise levels. This includes transitioning from import substitution to export-led growth and creating an enabling environment for new firms.


-   **Future Industrial Policy**
A futuristic industrial policy aims at creating a globally competitive industrial structure and rewarding efficiency and productivity over lobbying skills. It emphasizes the importance of self-sustaining industries and a gradual transition to an innovation-driven economy.

---

**Challenges and Goals**
Developing an effective industrial policy faces challenges from vested interests and maneuvering of policy forums. The vital goal is to steer the transition towards an efficiency-driven export-led economy in the medium term and innovation-driven in the long term.


**Conclusion**
Building a globally competitive industrial structure requires strategic reforms and a long-term vision. Despite challenges, the goal of achieving export-led growth and innovation-driven economy remains paramount for Pakistan's industrial development.
