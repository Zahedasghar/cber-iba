
Pakistan is behaving like a landlocked country. Protected, not open to free trade, sitting to next two leading economies China and India
but yet landlocked.
Closed protected... this equilibrium  is suitable for Pakistan elite
for jobs, industry
more trade is better
Liberalization: opening up economy
high import tariffs: monopolists get extra money from consumers not because you are better
India was the case in 1970s and 80s
Liberalization: deregulation, privatization, globalization
Removing trade barriers 

Genuine ownership of agenda of liberalization
Politics of economic reforms Book

Domestic policy makers are not truly sincere with reforms 

SROs: Statutory Regulatory Orders
Pressure to reduce import duties, customs and tariffs but lot of protected industries, now you have a different ways of protecting industries 
But has this not led to more increasing deficits


When trade deficit is increasing, in 2008 a new instrument was introduced, called Regulatory duties because you cant increase trariffs.
There is a difference between tariffs and regulatory duties. Tariffas are taxes on imports, international agencies will not allow to increase tariffs, but you can increase regulatory duties.
Tariffs: Parliamentary approval
Regulatory duties: no parliamentary approval but cabinet approval
Regulatory duties: emergency
2008, 2013

SROs: Statutory Regulatory Orders : one wants preferential treatment, you can get it through SROs
Industrial code.... has exemptions
SROs are probably not through cabinet but through FBR, energy efficiency refrigerators, you can get a preferential treatment
1000s of SROs, elite capture

SROs: exemptions
some are good but mostly bad

Trade Policy: 2001 uninterupted, 2013 reversal

Non tariff barriers to trade: regulatory duties, SROs, quotas, licensing, etc
Trade policy: 2001-2013
Pakistan elite: NTBs 
SROs are more discretionary and non-transparent

We are raising revenue through trade policy, not through tax policy
This is criminal. You are killing industry, you are killing exports, you are killing jobs

Raising revenue through trade policy, means you are not ready to tax rich people
and second is you are protecting your industry where you have benefits
